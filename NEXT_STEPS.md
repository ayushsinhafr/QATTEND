## ðŸ“¥ **Easy Model Download Options:**

### **Option 1: Quick Test Model (Recommended)**
I recommend this lightweight model for testing:

**Direct Download Link:**
```
https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/vision/body_analysis/facenet/model/facenet.onnx
```

**Steps:**
1. Right-click the link above
2. Save the file to: `d:\Downloads\SAVES\bg\attend-easy-qr-main\public\models\facenet.onnx`
3. Restart your dev server
4. Face recognition will work!

### **Option 2: Alternative Model**
If the above doesn't work, try this MobileFaceNet model:
```
https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/releases/download/v0.7/models.zip
```
Extract and use the `.onnx` file.

### **Option 3: I Can Help You**
If you prefer, I can:
1. Create a mock/demo mode that simulates face recognition
2. Help you find and configure a specific model
3. Guide you through the download and setup process step by step
